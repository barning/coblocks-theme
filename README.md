# CoBlocks WordPress Theme

#### Notice: The CoBlocks WordPress theme in being deprecated in favor of <a href="https://github.com/godaddy-wordpress/go">Go WordPress theme</a>. Since I like this theme a lot and also made a pull-request in the original repository myself, I will try to continue it.

## Development ##
1. Clone the GitHub repository: `https://github.com/godaddy/coblocks-theme.git`
2. Browse to the folder in the command line.
3. Run the `npm install` command to install the theme's dependencies within a /node_modules/ folder.
4. Run the `default` gulp task for development.
5. Run the `build` gulp task to process build files and generate a zip.
